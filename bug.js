In React Native, a less common error arises when using AsyncStorage with large data sets or complex objects.  Directly storing large JSON objects can lead to performance issues and potential data corruption. This is because AsyncStorage is optimized for smaller key-value pairs, and serializing and deserializing large objects can be slow and memory-intensive.  The error itself might manifest as unexpected behavior, crashes, or silent data loss. For example:

```javascript
// Problematic code
const largeDataObject = { /* ...a large object... */ };
AsyncStorage.setItem('myData', JSON.stringify(largeDataObject))
  .then(() => {
    // ...
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error saving data:', error);
  });
```
